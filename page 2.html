                Professor Richard Zare in his lab. Whether it's the summer<br>
                grass that tickles your feet or the red Bordeaux smacking on<br>
                your palate, nearly every part of the world around you carries<br>
                special chemical markers. These markers, called isotopes, can <br>
                tell scientists where the molecules that compose a substance<br>
                are from, where they traveled and what happened to them<br>
                along the way. But doing these analyses has been complex<br>
                and costly. Now, Stanford chemists have developed a new<br>
                method to make isotopic analysis easier and less expensive.</p>

                Stanford is an epicenter for the vintage dance movement—but<br>
                life in the Stanford dance world is not all foxtrots and tangos.<br>
                The June 26-28 Stanford’s Dance Weekend in Roble Gym<br>
                offers something for modern dance enthusiasts, too: the<br>
                hustle, the West Coast swing, 1970s disco hustle, Bollywood<br>
                and blues fusion.</p>
