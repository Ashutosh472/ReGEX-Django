        <h1>Patrick Young</h1>
        <p>I am a lecturer in the Stanford Computer Science Department.Before coming to Stanford, I spent two years as a<br>
           programmer at Taligent (now part of IBM). At Taligent, I worked on Places for Project Teams, a groupware product<br>
           designed to improve communication and coordination within small project teams. I was fortunate to work with the Places for<br>
           Project Teams product throughout an entire software lifecycleâ€”from initial product conception through the actual product<br>
           launch.<br></p>
        <p>I have a Ph.D. from the University of California, Irvine, where I specialized in Software Engineering. My dissertation was on<br>
           process support for software engineering teams. I also have a masters degree from Irvine, with a specialization in Artificial<br>
           Intelligence, and bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.</p>
